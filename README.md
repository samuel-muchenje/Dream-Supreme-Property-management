Welcome to the **Dream Supreme** internal operations platform.

Dream Supreme is a modern, next-generation web application designed to handle the end-to-end lifecycle of South African real estate operations. It operates as a secure, multi-tenant portal that enables property practitioners, principals, admins, and conveyancing attorneys to collaborate seamlessly.

## 🌟 Core Modules & Capabilities

The platform is designed to replace fragmented spreadsheets and legacy CRMs by centralizing:

### 1. Sales & Deal Workflows

- Track properties from initial Mandate to Registered Deal.
- Manage Suspensive Conditions, OTPs, and strict stage transitions.
- **60-Second Express Deal Capture** modal for rapid agent pipeline entry.
- Live Countdown Boards to monitor deal expiries.

### 2. Document Storage & Agent Quotas

- Agency- and agent-scoped storage namespaces (`<agency_id>/...`, `users/<user_id>/...`), enforced by Supabase Storage RLS policies and mirrored app-side authorization checks (`verifyStorageAccessAuthorization`). Direct client-side Cloudflare R2 access is intentionally disabled — see `src/lib/storage.ts` for the rationale — so all object storage runs through Supabase Storage.
- Per-agent storage allocation enforcement (1 GB default) with interactive Admin quota override controls.

### 3. System Settings & Governance Hub (`/admin/settings`)

- **General & Health**: Real-time DB latency diagnostics and infrastructure status badges.
- **Storage Governance**: Bucket parameters (`mandate-documents`), signed URL policies, and agent quota configuration.
- **Security & Access**: Idle session timeout rules, MFA enforcement, registration approval policies, and allowed domain filters (`dreamsupreme.co.za`).
- **Notification & Gateway Status**: Automated event dispatchers and dynamic integration status checks (WhatsApp, Auth Mailer, Conveyancer Webhooks, Xero/Sage Sync).
- **Automated Maintenance**: Configurable retention thresholds for deal archival, idle agent deactivation, and recycle bin purging.

### 4. Commission Engine

- Automated, rule-based commission splits based on agency defaults or agent-specific overrides.
- Automated clawbacks and recalculations for canceled deals.
- **Compliance Blockers:** The engine automatically halts payouts if participating agents lack valid Fidelity Fund Certificates (FFC).

### 5. Conveyancer Portal

- External attorneys receive secure, single-use, time-expiring "magic links" to update deal statuses (e.g., Lodged, Registered) directly into the agency's database.

### 6. Rentals Management

- Dedicated dashboard for active lease agreements.
- Financial ledger tracking monthly invoices, utilities, and deposits.
- Maintenance ticket logging with photo attachment support.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18, Vite 8, TypeScript
- **Routing & State:** `@tanstack/react-router` (file-based routing), `@tanstack/react-query` (server state)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, `shadcn/ui`, Framer Motion (animations)
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Realtime)
- **Storage:** Supabase Storage (object storage, RLS-scoped). Direct client-side Cloudflare R2 access is disabled by design — see `src/lib/storage.ts`.
- **Security:** Strict PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS) handles all data isolation. The UI uses `<AuthGuard>` for routing, with database-layer session authorization.

## 🔐 Authentication & Security

Dream Supreme is an invitation-only enterprise platform:

1. **Master Admin & Agent Auth**: Passwords are authenticated via Supabase Auth with bcrypt/JWT claims.
2. **Show Password Option**: Login screen supports interactive password visibility toggling.
3. **Database RLS**: Multi-tenant database isolation ensures users only see data belonging to their agency.
4. **Storage Authorization**: File downloads require an active authenticated session, enforced by agency-scoped storage RLS policies plus an app-level check restricting agents to their own agency or user path.
